# This is an example and template for a Home2L 'resources.conf' file.
# In its present form, it specifies the hosts and resources for the
# Home2L tutorial.





############################## Default port ####################################

# Syntax: P <port>
#
# Define the default port if no port is specified with the respective host
# declaration.

P 4700





############################## Home2L Hosts ####################################

# Syntax: H <host ID> [<hostspec>]
#
#    <hostspec> ::= [<instance>@]<net host>[:<port>]
#
# Declare a Home2L host (servers). <host ID> is the host ID as visible
# by other instances. If no <hostspec> is given, <host ID> is equivalent to the
# network host name, and the default port is used.
#
# <net host>[:<port>] is the network host name and network IP port the server
# is listening on.
#
# <instance> is the instance name of the respective server. It is only needed
# if multiple servers run on the same machine.
#
# Servers/hosts are also implicitly declared by the aliases and variables
# (which is equivalent to an explicit declaration without <hostspec>).

H showhouse   showhouse@localhost:4700
H server      server@localhost:4701
H wallclock   wallclock@localhost:4702





############################## Signals #########################################

# Syntax: S <host> <name> <type> [<default value>]
#
#         <type> ::= bool | int | float | percent | temp | window | trigger | mutex
#
# Will be handled by the "signal" driver, all signals are read- and writable.
# URI is /host/<host>/signal/<name> .


# Use state ...
#   The use state is a central signal resource indicating whether the user is
#   present, sleeping, away, or away for longer (e.g. on vaction). Depending on
#   this, the Home2L system may perform actions or present alerts (e.g. about
#   open windows if the user is about to leave).
#   In the demo system, this signal is attached to the 'wallclock' instance,
#   and an automatic preset ('day'/'night') is set by the 'showhouse-rules'
#   script. In a real system, the "use" signal may be placed in a more central
#   instance (e.g. a server), so that all wallclocks have the same view on it.
S wallclock use          use


# Gadget stubs ...
#   The floorplan contains some gadgets for which no simluated or real resource
#   exists in the demo system.
#   For these gadgets we define stub signals here. These signals are assigned
#   to the 'showhouse' instance and provided by its signal driver in the
#   background.
S showhouse fp_mail         bool    false
S showhouse fp_phone        phone   idle
S showhouse fp_music        bool    false
S showhouse fp_wlan         bool    false
S showhouse fp_temp_living  temp    20.8
S showhouse fp_temp_bath    temp    22.4
S showhouse fp_temp_bedroom temp    19.2





############################## Aliases #########################################

# Syntax: A <aliasName> <destPath>
#         <destPath> may be relative to '/alias/' or absolute.
#         A '!' makes the resource persistent.

A weather         /host/server/weather
  # This makes the whole "weather" subtree visible at '/alias/weather'.
  # If later the weather driver is executed on a different host, this is the
  # only line that needs to be changed then.
