This directory contains external libraries, mainly needed for the android app.

NOTE: The contents of these directory is provided "as is". Building the external
      libraries will most probably require manual work. Information on how to
      obtain and propare the sources can (partially) be found as comments
      in the 'prebuild.sh' scripts.

The naming conventions inside each sub-project directory are:

src           - source files obtained externally, no own code, local changes must be documented

prebuild.sh   - Script to generate the prebuilt library,
                includes further documentation (e.g. on obtaining the sources) as comments.
                Results are written to 'usr.new', which may then manually be moved to 'usr'.
