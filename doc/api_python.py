## @mainpage
## This is the documentation of the **Python API** of the <em>Home2L</em> suite.
## It is meant as a reference for authors of
## - automation rules,
## - drivers and software tools written in *Python*.
##
## The main purpose of this page is to give a list and overview on the existing
## *Python* functions and classes.
##
## The [*Home2L Book*](../home2l-book.pdf) contains explanations on
## concepts and examples. Additional information on the lower-level functions
## and classes can be found in the [*C/C++ API documentation*](../home2l-api_c/index.html).
## Most of the information presented here is also available as *Python docstrings*
## (avaliable via `help(<name>)` in a *Python* shell).
##
## To get started, navigate to the [Modules](modules.html) page.
